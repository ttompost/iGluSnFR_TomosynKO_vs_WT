# Project description:
Fluorescence imaging of the cultured excitatory neurons expressing an optical reporter named iGluSnFR (Marvin et al., 2013). iGluSnFR is sensitive to glutamate, hence it allows for detection of excitatory synaptic activiy with single synapse precision.

Herein provided scripts contain the code for the set of figures comparing the activity of Tomosyn knockout (KO) neurons with the wild type (WT) response. Both cell lines undergo electrical stimulation with the local field potential electrode. Their response is recorded under the epifluorescence microscope.
